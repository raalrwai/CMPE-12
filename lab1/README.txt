-------------------------
What did you learn in this lab?
How to apply truth tables to build different circuits.
This included using the platform MMlogic to build circuits.
These circuits consisted of AND and NAND logic gates as well
as senders and recievers.
What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
MMLogic worked well on my computer. I didnt experience many
issues. Some of the material was difficult but I was able
to understand after going to lab.
How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
Maybe more tutorials on how to build each NAND/NOR gate. 
Also some installation examples for different computer users.
